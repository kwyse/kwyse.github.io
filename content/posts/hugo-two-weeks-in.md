My [last post](/posts/hail-hugo) about Hugo focused on getting it set up. It finished with a few
ideas on improvements. Maybe you've noticed a few implemented since then =]


## One-liner improvements {#one-liner-improvements}

Some of these were very simple to add. The theme I'm using, [Minimo](https://minimo.netlify.com/), supports
adding a reading time to posts with one addition to `config.toml`.

```nil
showReadingTime = true
```

It's a small addition yet adds noted value for the reader.

The next change instead provides insight for the sight maintainer:

```nil
googleAnalytics = "[your Google Analytics tracking ID]"
```

Once your site starts getting some traffic, [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) can help you create
more targeted content.

I've also enabled my RSS feed to display the full contents of an article rather
than just the summary. You can do that by overriding the default `rss.xml` file
(add your own `layouts/_default/rss.xml` and it will take precedence) and
changing

```nil
<description>{{ .Summary | html }}</description>
```

to

```nil
<description>{{ .Content | html }}</description>
```

Kudos to Brian Wisti for his [post](https://randomgeekery.org/2017/09/15/full-content-hugo-feeds/) on this technique.

The final quick addition is taxonomies. I've started a series called _This Week
I Discovered_ where, each week, I plan to discuss something cool I found in the
last seven days. These posts should naturally be grouped together. Hugo calls
such a grouping a [_taxonomy_](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/). Two taxonomies are provided for us: _categories_
and _tags_, but we can easily add our own as well, such as a _series_ taxonomy.

Enabling a taxonomy requires the name of it to be included in at least one
post's front matter:

```nil
series: ["This Week I Discovered"]
```


## Somewhat effortful improvements {#somewhat-effortful-improvements}

Adding a comments section could have been easy. Hugo supports [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments
out of the box. In your `config.toml`, simply add:

```nil
disqusShortname = "[your Disqus short name]"
```

I ended up going this route, but there are alternatives.  [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), for
example, doesn't require the comments to be stored by a third-party. It's much
more appropriate for a static-content site. Staticman listens for incoming
`POST` requests that such a site would generate and then creates a pull request
to the repository with the comment contents. It can be configured to merge the
PRs immediately or delegate to the repository owner, which provides comment
moderation. It's a really nice idea.

The problem is that it the comments form does not look that great in Minimo. I
spent some time tweaking it but form design is not my forte.  I'd like to move
to Staticman in the future if a designer will alleviate me of that burden ;)
Suffice to say, the comments section took some time to investigate and play
around with.

The biggest pain point was TLS, and it could have been so easy! The lesson here
is to always read the documentation. Each day, I would spend a bit of time
trying to find out why my site was so slow to initially load. The first
incarnation of this site didn't have this problem, and was hosted on the same
DigitalOcean setup, so I ruled that out. It seemed like a DNS lookup issue,
because performance was good once the site was loaded, but I couldn't tell if
this was on Namecheap's side or something I had misconfigured with Nanobox given
it was my first time using it.

The investigation led me discovering that [cURL can provide timings](https://blog.josephscott.org/2011/10/14/timing-details-with-curl/)! There's also
an [awesome little script](https://github.com/mat/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/curlt) to save you from having to type out the long
version. It confirmed immediately that the issue was indeed DNS lookup. I took a
closer look at my Namecheap DNS configuration and found that I was redirecting
traffic to the TLS version of the site. Nginx, running inside my Nanobox, wasn't
playing nice with this setup. Then I took another look at the [README](https://github.com/nanobox-io/nanobox-engine-static/blob/master/README.md) for the
Nanobox static site engine and saw that forcing HTTPS was supported at this
level!

```nil
force_https: true
```

Well I felt silly, but now the whole site is TLS enabled and loading within a
few hundred milliseconds. Much better than the ~75 seconds it was previously
taking!

The final task, and arguably the one with the biggest benefit, was to set up
automated deployments when pushing to GitHub. If you have a Travis CI account
and continuous integration enabled for the repository, simply add a
`.travis.yml` file with the following:

```nil
sudo: required
install: sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://s3.amazonaws.com/tools.nanobox.io/bootstrap/ci.sh)"

script:
  - nanobox remote add [your Nanobox project name]
  - nanobox deploy
```

Travis CI configuration files can be customised much more than this, but it
suffices for the simple use case. Now the site will automatically deploy itself
whenever pushing!


## Endless possibilities {#endless-possibilities}

One can never be truly done with a project like this. Outside of creating
content, there's always ways to improve the site itself. I think the main points
are covered now, but hopefully this is only the start of side projects for this
side project.
